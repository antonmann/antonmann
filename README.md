- 👋 Hi, I’m @antonmann
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything and anything about computer programming. Especially python and django.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science but I'm focusing on python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing much at the moment. I'm not useful enough for collaboration although I'm pretty good on use cases and user experience.
